# General

The Questionaire APIs first goal is to have a clean question database. 
Considering Multilangual usage only translation-keys should be used. 

GET Request: 
return the translation-key, no language preference
Additional Endpoints should be created to get a question or questionaire in a specific language


PUT POST etc. Requests 
(for now) Should only be posted in English 
- translation keys will be automatically generated, the english sentences will be used to update the translation file (also as additional nodes)
